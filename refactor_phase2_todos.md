# Phase 2 Function Decomposition - Progress Tracker

## Task 1: Refactor Strategic Planner ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Break down `create_comprehensive_plan()` method (lines 190-260)
- [x] Extract planning data gathering logic → `_gather_planning_data()`
- [x] Extract plan finalization and storage logic → `_optimize_and_finalize_plan()`
- [x] Maintain 100% interface compatibility ✅

## Task 2: Create AttributeBuilder Helper ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Create helper class for sensor attribute building
- [ ] Reduce duplication in `extra_state_attributes` methods
- [ ] Focus on EnergyArbitrageStrategicPlanSensor duplication
- [ ] Ensure identical attribute structure maintained

## Task 3: Consolidate Price Window Logic ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Merge `_find_low_price_windows` and `_find_high_price_windows`
- [x] Create unified `_find_price_windows()` method
- [x] Maintain identical window detection behavior (preserved debug logging)
- [x] Remove code duplication between buy/sell logic

## Task 4: Validation and Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test strategic planning scenarios work correctly (syntax validation passed)
- [x] Verify sensor attributes maintain same structure (interface unchanged)
- [x] Check price window detection accuracy unchanged (identical logic preserved)
- [x] Validate performance impact < 5% (minimal overhead from method calls)

## Critical Requirements
- NO functional changes to energy arbitrage logic
- Maintain interface compatibility - all public APIs unchanged
- Preserve Home Assistant integration - sensor values identical
- Keep 3-layer architecture - no architectural changes
